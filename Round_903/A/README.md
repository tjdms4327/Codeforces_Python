# A. Don't Try to Count


### LIMIT
time limit per test: 2 seconds

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes

### PROBLEM
Given a string x
 of length n
 and a string s
 of length m
 (n⋅m≤25
), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, you can apply any number of operations to the string x
.

In one operation, you append the current value of x
 to the end of the string x
. Note that the value of x
 will change after this.

For example, if x=
"aba", then after applying operations, x
 will change as follows: "aba" →
 "abaaba" →
 "abaabaabaaba".

After what minimum number of operations s
 will appear in x
 as a substring? A substring of a string is defined as a contiguous segment of it.

### Input
The first line of the input contains a single integer t
 (1≤t≤104
) — the number of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two numbers n
 and m
 (1≤n⋅m≤25
) — the lengths of strings x
 and s
, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains the string x
 of length n
.

The third line of each test case contains the string s
 of length m
.

### Output
For each test case, output a single number — the minimum number of operations after which s
 will appear in x
 as a substring. If this is not possible, output −1
.
