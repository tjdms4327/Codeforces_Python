# B. Heapify 1


### LIMIT
time limit per test: 2 seconds

memory limit per test: 256 megabytes


### PROBLEM
You are given a permutation a
 of length n
∗
.

You can perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):

Select an index i
 (1≤i≤n2
), and swap ai
 and a2i
.
For example, when a=[1,4,2,3,5]
, you can swap a2
 and a4
 to make it [1,3,2,4,5]
, but you cannot swap a2
 and a3
.

Please determine if the sequence a
 can be sorted in increasing order.

∗
A permutation of length n
 is an array consisting of n
 distinct integers from 1
 to n
 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4]
 is a permutation, but [1,2,2]
 is not a permutation (2
 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4]
 is also not a permutation (n=3
 but there is 4
 in the array).

### Input
Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t
 (1≤t≤104
). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n
 (1≤n≤2⋅105
).

The second line of each test case contains n
 distinct integers a1,a2,…,an
 (1≤ai≤n
).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n
 over all test cases does not exceed 2⋅105
.

### Output
If a
 can be sorted in increasing order, output "YES" on a separate line. Otherwise, output "NO" on a separate line.

You can output the answer in any case. For example, the strings "yEs", "yes", and "Yes" will also be recognized as positive responses.
